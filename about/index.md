## Overview
Hi, I'm Jordy, a recently graduated Acoustical Engineer from the UK. I'm currently working for a hearing technology startup based in Berlin.  

If you'd like to get in touch feel free to contact me on any of the methods given here.  

## What drives me?
I have a passion for hearing/digital health, as well as professional audio, my main aim is to try and use my formal knowledge of acoustics, audio and engineering in a way that can benefit people.  

This is further showcased by my volunteer work with [Action on Hearing Loss](https://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/) and my role as `Charity Officer` for the [Southampton University Sign Language Society](https://www.facebook.com/sotonsignsoc/) whilst at University.  

I am also passionate about Animal and Environmental Welfare. I volunteer at [Samtpfoten Neukölln](https://www.samtpfoten-neukoelln.com/) Cat Home in Berlin.  

Having grown up in many different countries as a child (🇩🇪🇳🇱🇦🇺🇴🇲🇬🇧). I have developed a love for travel. Whether it be for a vacation or to relocate and live somewhere new, I am excited by the prospect of learning more about new cultures.
