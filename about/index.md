## Overview
Hi, I'm Jordy, a recently graduated Acoustical Engineer from the UK. I'm currently working for a hearing technology startup based in Berlin. As well as this I am a volunteer teacher of an `Introduction to Python` programme at [ReDI school](https://www.redi-school.org/berlin) (see more below).

If you'd like to get in touch feel free to contact me on any of the methods given here.

## What drives me?
I have a passion for hearing/digital health, as well as professional audio, my main aim is to try and use my formal knowledge of acoustics, audio and engineering in a way that can benefit people.

This is further showcased by my volunteer work with [Action on Hearing Loss](https://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/) and my role as `Charity Officer` for the [Southampton University Sign Language Society](https://www.facebook.com/sotonsignsoc/) whilst at University.

I am also passionate about many social issues. In current company I am a lead member of the `Diversity and Inclusion` committee. Through this role I have also aimed to make our company have a more pro-active stance on social issues that surround our industry.

Having grown up in many different countries as a child (🇩🇪🇳🇱🇦🇺🇴🇲🇬🇧). I have developed a love for travel. Whether it be for a vacation or to relocate and live somewhere new, I am excited by the prospect of learning more about new cultures.

I also volunteer as a teacher on the [Intro to Python](https://www.redi-school.org/berlin-career-program) course at [ReDI school](https://www.redi-school.org/berlin) (of design interaction). This is a not-for-profit digital school whose [mission](https://www.redi-school.org/mission) is to use technology to break down barriers and connect the leaders of tomorrow. Primarily its courses are focused towards individuals who are new to the country they reside in. Typically, a lot of the students are refugees and are from non-traditional educational backgrounds. Teaching programmes with ReDI has been an amazingly rewarding process and I have definitely learnt a lot along the way.
