## Overview
Hi, I'm Jordy, an Acoustical Engineer and Audio Research Engineer originally from the UK. I am currently based in Melbourne, Australia where I am working as a Senior Software Developer for [`daisee`](https://www.daisee.com/). For more information on my development skillset please see my [resume]({{site.resume}}).

Currently at `daisee` I am working actively with the `AWS` Cloud Infrastructure technologies in order to better streamline and standardize the codebase used.

Previously, I worked part-time as an [academic assistant at CoderAcademy]({{site.url}}/coderAcademy/) on their [WebDev Bootcamp](https://www.coderacademy.edu.au/web-development-bootcamp) course. It was an experience to further my teaching knowledge by inspiring a new generation of developers.

My main freelance client has been [Mimi Hearing Technologies]({{site.url}}/mimi_hearing_technologies), a company where I previously worked full-time. They are a hearing health based startup in Berlin, DE. Whilst living in Berlin and [working for Mimi]({{site.url}}/mimi_hearing_technologies) I undertook volunteer work as a teacher of `Introduction to Python` program at [ReDI school](https://www.redi-school.org/berlin) (see more below).

I also have a passion for SCUBA diving, and am a `PADI Open Water SCUBA Instructor (OWSI)`. I intend to work professionally in both the technology and diving industries, with a higher weighting towards the technology industry. I have a positive experience of this in the past.

If you'd like to get in touch feel free to contact me on any of the methods given here. I am always open to new opportunities and experiences. I'm more than happy to have a chat about how my skillset can fit in with your project, company or team.

## What drives me?
I have a passion for hearing/digital health, as well as professional audio, my main aim is to try and use my formal knowledge of acoustics, audio and engineering in a way that can benefit people.

This is further showcased by my volunteer work with [Action on Hearing Loss](https://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/) and my role as `Charity Officer` for the [Southampton University Sign Language Society](https://www.facebook.com/sotonsignsoc/) whilst at University.

In my free time in Melbourne, I volunteer with various different community and charitable organizations.

* [Reaching out in the Inner West](https://reachingoutintheinnerwestofmelbourne.com.au/): Volunteer weekly supplying food, bedding, clothing
etc to ~500+ in need individuals.
* [Music in Exile](https://musicinexile.com.au/): Volunteer at various events for a not for profit record label. Working
with artists from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.
    * Music in Exile is a not-for-profit record label and artist services organisation aimed at increasing access to resources and building professional networks for artists from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds working in the music industry.

* [Welcome Merchant](https://welcomemerchant.com/): Volunteer at food pop-ups and events to help to champion and support businesses from those in under-represented and marginalized communities.
    * Welcome Merchant's mission is: `to champion the voices of entrepreneurs & artists who identify as a refugee or as a person seeking asylum in Australia`.
* Mimi Hearing Technologies: leading member of the `Diversity and Inclusion` committee.
    * Through this role I have also aimed to make Mimi have a more pro-active stance on social issues that surround our industry.

Having grown up in many different countries as a child (🇩🇪🇳🇱🇦🇺🇴🇲🇬🇧). I have developed a love for travel. Whether it be for a vacation or to relocate and live somewhere new, I am excited by the prospect of learning more about new cultures.

I loved volunteering teaching on the [Intro to Python](https://www.redi-school.org/berlin-career-program) course at [ReDI school](https://www.redi-school.org/berlin) (of design interaction). This is a not-for-profit digital school whose [mission](https://www.redi-school.org/mission) is to use technology to break down barriers and connect the leaders of tomorrow. Primarily its courses are focused towards individuals who are new to the country they reside in. Typically, a lot of the students are refugees and are from non-traditional educational backgrounds. Teaching programs with ReDI has been an amazingly rewarding process and I have definitely learned a lot along the way.
