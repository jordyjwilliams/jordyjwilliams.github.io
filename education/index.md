* `Signal Processing of acoustic emissions to identify Osteoarthritis in the knee joint`
* More detail of this can be seen in the image above. This poster formed part of a student conference where my work was formally presented.

### Master's Year Project || `Pearable`
* Group design project, with 6 other cross-disciplinary engineers
* Designed, built and tested a freely programmable, `hearable`
* Implemented on a Raspberry Pi 3B
* I took the lead in A2DP Bluetooth Audio Transfer as well as writing an [Android Smartphone Application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.JJgames.pearable&hl=en) scripted in Xamarin and C#.
* Was able to freely and dynamically control the function on a Python scripted (Pi-side) server.
* All code for this project is available publicly through [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/hearablegdp/pearable-gdp-code/src)
