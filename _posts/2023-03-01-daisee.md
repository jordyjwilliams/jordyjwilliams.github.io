Currently working as a `Senior Software Engineer` at [daisee](https://www.daisee.com/). This is a role where I have learned a great deal in an intense, rewarding and fast paced start-up environment. I have been working primarily in a `Client` and `Customer Support` engineering role. To this end I have had to deal with a lot of legacy code, maintainability issues and having pressure from various different internal stakeholders.

I have been instrumental in re-designing the `Way the CS and Engineering teams` function together. This has drastically reduced friction and the needs for frequent meetings by up to 4 hours of meetings/week. I have also focussed strongly on building internal tooling so that teams can self service frequent requests. Reducing the toil on the engineering team by up to 80%.

Roles and responsibilities:
* Helped streamline client onboarding and ingestion. Key focus: scalability. 
* Implemented a new type of scorecard questions using LLMs.
* Wrote tooling enabling internal stakeholders to self-serve. Toil reduction: 60%.
* Implemented telemetry, observability and CICD in legacy projects.
* Reduced tech-debt (by ~40%) and planned work packages to implement a standard ingestion pipeline is highly scalable.
* Championed: code quality, unit testing and a cultural shift within the team.
* Key skills: Software design (Event Driven Systems), Python, AWS, IaC (Terraform),
