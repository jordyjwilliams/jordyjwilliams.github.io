Following my previous work with AECOM in the UK, I given the opportunity to intern in Christchurch, New Zealand.

* Gained a different view on acoustic consultancy (due to the differing regulations between NZ and the UK). 
* Noise and annoyance subjective survey design and data analysis.
   * Processing and trend identification
   * Large data set manipulation
   * Overall results allowed us to quantify annoyance due to road traffic noise.
   * First study of its kind in New Zealand.

* Authored a Python utility module to help with survey analysis
* Implemented networked real-time logging devices on noise surveys

* Furthered software skills in the following:
   * CadnA Acoustics
   * Rhino
   * CATTAcoustics
   * Odeon
   * SketchUp
   * AutoCAD
   * MATLAB/Python
   * Excel/VBA
