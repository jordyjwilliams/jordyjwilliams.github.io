Currently I am working part-time as an academic assistant at [CoderAcademy](TODO:CApage) on their [WebDev Bootcamp](TODO:linktoCoderacademy) course. I am assisting with teaching 3 times a week on 4 hour online lessons with ~30+ students. Depending on the cohort there can be as many as 90 students (typically these will be split off into breakout rooms with many Educators!). The course is fairly fast paced with a standard and accelerated streams. It provides a very through and well-rounded overview of all elements of web and full stack development. The students are very diverse and have hugely varied desires to get into the industry. They can start the course with only basic IT skills. After study for XX or YY months (standard vs accelerated respectively), they are prepared to apply for entry level full stack or web dev positions.

My roles and responsibilities include:
* Provide support to (on average) 30-40 students during online lessons.
* Answer student questions asynchronously outside of lessons across 3-4 simultaneous cohorts.
* Manage, maintain and run 3-5 Zoom meetings per week updating with class and curriculum details.
* Upload, create and catalog meeting: notes, recordings and chat logs for 10+ hours of meetings per week.
* Write, run and provide feedback for: quizzes and [code challenges](https://github.com/CoderAcademy-ALL/ed_challenges_term3_javascript/tree/main/part2) for each of the 2+ lessons per week.
