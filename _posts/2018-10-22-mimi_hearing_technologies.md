Currently working for a Hearing Technology startup company as an Audio Engineer.

Our core tech is a medically certified hearing test, allowing for a scientifically informed and biologically inspired audio personalization solution. Our processing is dynamic, complex and  offers a truly personal solution. All of this is rolled into a SDK with the aim of being [integrated easily](https://integrate.mimi.io/) by [external partners](https://www.mimi.io/partners). Our processing is also capable of running on a multitude of common [industry standard chipsets and devices](https://integrate.mimi.io/solutions/select-platform).

My role as an Audio Engineer transitions the product and research teams, primarily concerning the sonic experience given to the end user of our technology (their personalized sound).

Through working in a dynamic start-up environment I was able to further my knowledge in:
* Working in cross-functional scrum teams:
   * Using both Agile & Kanban frameworks
* Was able to improve my skills as a developer:
   * Code-review, automated CICD testing and deployment (CircleCI) and QA
   * Python skills built and improved
   * Was able to learn a functioning understanding of `C++, bash, lua & yaml`
* Helped develop and QA new hearing testing methodologies
* Real-time audio processing
* Porting to different chip-sets
* Database management and interaction (`MongoDB, PyMongo, Postgres, SQL`)
* The interaction between different business areas and their interaction:
   * Was able to see product ideas from initial design and research ideas come to fruition in a product.
   * For example: design, development, partner integrations & BizDev/Marketing
